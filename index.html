            <p>Joseph Stalin was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1953. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="political-career" class="tab">
            <p>Joseph Stalin was never a brilliant orator like Adolf Hitler or Vladimir Lenin. He did not write books or articles about the misery of working people.</p>
    
        </div>
        <div id="war-leadership" class="tab">
            <p>In 1939, Stalin and Hitler signed a non-aggression pact, which stated that the U.S.S.R. and Germany could divide Poland and not attack each other for ten years. Stalin felt comfortable with the agreement and believed that Hitler would abide by it</p>

        </div>
        <div id="policies" class="tab">
            <p>When Lenin died in 1924, Stalin started eliminating the Partyâ€™s old officers. He initially dismissed them from their positions and then sent them into exile. However, these expelled officers could still hurl written attacks on Stalin, so the new dictator adopted a new, aggressive strategy.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="legacy" class="tab">
            <p>A politician to the marrow of his bones, Stalin had little private or family life, finding his main relaxation in impromptu buffet suppers, to which he would invite high party officials, generals, visiting foreign potentates, and the like</p>
